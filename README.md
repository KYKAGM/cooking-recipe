# 🍽️ Cooks Delight

Cooks Delight is a modern cooking and recipe website built with React.  
The project was developed as a university session project and demonstrates the use of component-based architecture, client-side routing, responsive layout, and clean UI design inspired by contemporary food blogs.

The application allows users to explore featured recipes, browse food categories, and navigate between pages in a smooth single-page application experience.
