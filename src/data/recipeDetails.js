        { title: "What kind of meat should I use for beshbarmak?", text: "Lamb is most often used for beshbarmak . Horse meat is also often used, either as is or in the form of raw horse sausage called kazy . Nowadays, due to changes in civilization, this soup is also made with beef, but then the meat must be fatty. The choice of cut depends on the scale of the undertaking: from a whole ram with the head to—for a more modest occasion—just the front half, excluding the butt. Neck and fatty brisket are excellent beef cuts. The meat should be trimmed and chopped into 300–400 g pieces. It is recommended to dry the kazy for 24 hours before cooking; the sausage bundles are often hung near the fire pit at a height of 2 meters for gentle smoking." },
        { title: "How to cook beshbarmak correctly", text: "In its natural habitat, beshbarmak is served on a meter-diameter dish containing about 15 kilograms of the dish. The treat is distributed ceremoniously and strictly according to seniority, with the pieces arranged in rank order, and there's no room for error; this is usually the host's responsibility. The most honored guest receives the head, or just the eyes if there's more than one. However, these traditions are best studied from ethnographic sources. We'll focus on the preparation process:Place the whole kazy in a large, or rather, enormous pot, cover with cold water and put on the fire – kazy takes the longest to cook.After an hour of boiling, add the meat in large chunks and continue cooking for another 2 hours, until both the kazy and the meat are done. Then, remove the kazy and meat with a slotted spoon onto a tray or a separate cauldron with a lid to keep warm.Skim the fat from the broth and pour it over the chopped onions. While the broth is still simmering, add the noodles and cook for 10-15 minutes. Quite often, either whole or quartered potatoes are added first, followed by the noodles after about 10 minutes.Once the noodles are cooked, they and the potatoes are scooped out onto a large platter. The potatoes are arranged around the edges, leaving the noodles in the center. Meat is placed on top of the noodles, and thickly sliced ​​kazy is placed closer to the edge. The entire dish is drizzled with onions simmered in fat. Beshbarmak is eaten with the hands; in fact, the besh  in the name is the sign for  five in many Turkic languages.The broth is poured into cups or bowls/kasas and served separately to be washed down." },
        { title: "How to make beshbarmak at home", text: "Place the kazy in a large, heavy saucepan, cover with cold water, cover, and place over high heat. Once it boils, reduce the heat to low, loosen the lid slightly, and continue cooking for 1 hour.After an hour, add the beef and lamb, increase the heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat again and skim off any foam. Continue simmering for another 2 hours, covered. Fifteen minutes before the end of cooking, add 10 black peppercorns, 10 allspice berries, and 5 bay leaves.While the meat is cooking, prepare the noodles. Mix flour, eggs, and water, knead the dough, cover, and let it rest for 20–30 minutes. Roll it out thinly and cut into diamond-shaped shapes with sides measuring 3–4 cm. Pat dry and shake off any flour.Peel and slice the onion into thin strips and place in a separate bowl with a lid. Peel and coarsely chop the potatoes.After 3 hours, remove the pieces of meat and kazy from the broth with a slotted spoon and place them on a baking sheet, cover with foil to keep warm, or place in an oven preheated to 100°C.Place the chopped onion in a colander and dip the colander bottom into the boiling broth several times, or use a ladle to pour the boiling broth over the onion several times. Transfer to the original container, skim off the top layer of fat (300–400 ml) with a flat spoon, and pour over the onion, sprinkled with black pepper. Cover and set aside.Bring the broth to a boil over high heat and add the potatoes. After 10 minutes, add the noodles and continue cooking for another 10–12 minutes (test the noodles after 8 minutes to determine doneness; cooking time depends on the strength of the flour).Prepare a large serving dish or tray. Pour the broth through a large colander into another saucepan and return to the heat.Place the noodles and potatoes from the colander onto a plate or tray, pushing the potatoes to the edge. Arrange the pieces of meat on top of the noodles. Cut the kazy into 15 mm thick slices and arrange them along the edge. Scatter the steamed onions on top.Pour the broth into 300–500 ml cups or bowls. Serve the dish, dispensing the broth separately." },

Incidentally, she disliked honey, but simply \"rejected\" it in this form and ordered it prepared regularly. When the truth was revealed, the Empress didn't reverse her decision, but merely laughed at the chef's boldness. Thus, Medovik cake began to win the hearts of those with a sweet tooth, and, it's worth noting, continues to do so to this day. The cake layers are very tender and crumbly, and the pleasant tartness of the sour cream delicately counteracts their cloying sweetness.
